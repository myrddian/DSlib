DSLib - Simply named is a collection of data science methods and or techniques which I've learnt during my time, 
it was split from another project I was working on called MarkoDB. The idea was that these algorithms would
later be incorporated back into MarkovDB.

### Languages

At the moment the idea is to support 2 or more languages, these are at the moment, Java and C#, depending on time I might
add RUST.

### Focus

This library is a little bit more focused on Generative models and classifiers, as such you wont see a broad
range of algorithms like SPARK, because it was split from MarkovDB it also has a focus on graph and category theory.
